Console Tasker is very easy to install and configure.

## Installation

Require the package with Composer:

```bash
composer require cerbero/console-tasker
```

## Configuration

This step is **optional** but allows us to customize Console Tasker depending on our needs.

Run this command to publish the package configuration to `config/console-tasker`:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=console-tasker
```

Let's have a look at the settings one-by-one:


### `tasks_directory`

Here is the directory where all tasks should be put in. By default tasks can be implemented or auto-generated in `app/Console/Tasks` but we can change it as we need.


### `printer`

This setting allows us to set a custom printer, the responsible for showing tasks outcome in the console.

The default printer uses [Termwind](https://github.com/nunomaduro/termwind), a great tool to render HTML and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) utility classes in your terminal. ‚ú®

<alert>

To build and customize your own printer, have a look at [this section](building-printer).

### `modifiers`

Modifiers provide a quick way to specify the implementation of a task generated via Artisan. There are 2 modifiers available by default:

- <badge>c</badge> the generated task extends `Cerbero\ConsoleTasker\Tasks\FileCreator` which makes it easy to auto-generate files in your app.

- <badge>e</badge> the generated task extends `Cerbero\ConsoleTasker\Tasks\FilesEditor` which makes it easy to auto-generate code in your existing files.

More modifiers can be added or replaced with our own task implementations, speeding up the generation of the tasks that we use the most.

If this sounds confusing at the moment - and it probably does ü§î - have a look at [this section](generating-tasks) for more info.

### `verbs`

If you are a lazy dev - like me üêº - and find it tedious or don't like to add modifiers when generating tasks, you can associate the verbs you use to name tasks to a given task implementation.

By default when we generate a task which name starts with `create` or `generate`, a task extending `Cerbero\ConsoleTasker\Tasks\FileCreator` is generated.

Likewise, when we generate a task which name starts with `add` or `update`, a task extending `Cerbero\ConsoleTasker\Tasks\FilesEditor` is generated.

Feel free to change verbs and add your own task implementations as you need!

Again, all this will hopefully make more sense after reading [this section](generating-tasks). üôÇ
